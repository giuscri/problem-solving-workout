# Problem solving workout

Picking a new language or system administration was
extremely easy to me but I had to admit I needed to
workout my problem solving skills.

Whenever I had to wait for a bus or a train, I picked a
problem -- heard about it, read about it, thought about it
-- and tried to solve it.

I produced (and still producing) lots of dirty code, but
definitely I found out that my hard coding-skills improved
over time.
